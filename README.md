This project is my implementation of Flashcards app which is the final assessment project for the
Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/nd019).

The Flashcards Project is the third and last project from the Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree program. We build a flashcards mobile app to allow users to study questions and terms for example.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
